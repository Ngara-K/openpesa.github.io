## Why Openpesa

We’re doing this instead of releasing code under our personal accounts for a few reasons, but the main reason is this:

- A problem shared is a problem halved. Working together we take care of business quicker, can get more feedback and respond to issues and pull requests faster.

-  There are no plans to reinvent any wheels, unless those wheels are old, broken, unsafe or horrible to use. If the code cannot be installed with NOM, has an API written with BizZaroCapS, doesn’t have a single unit-test, is actually broken or the lead developer has abandoned the project, then that is a problem which can most likely be solved with a fresh start, and we’ll be on the case to make it as awesome as possible.
